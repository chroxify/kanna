/**
 * The way back from a sub-chat to the chat it reports to, for when no message
 * on screen provides one.
 *
 * A sub-chat is in no list of chats (`isSubChat`), so the way back to its
 * parent has to be in its own transcript. It is: the message that started the
 * sub-chat came from the parent's agent, and over its bubble is the parent's
 * row, the same quote the parent draws on the report that comes back
 * (`ChatReplyQuote`).
 *
 * That message is not always there to carry it. A chat opens on its last
 * stretch, and in a long one the opening message is pages above, not loaded.
 * And a chat taken on by another parent after it began opens with a message
 * from someone else. In both cases this draws the same quote on its own, as
 * the first item of whatever is loaded, so getting back never takes loading
 * the whole chat. It is the quote as it looks over a message, with no line
 * under it: there is no bubble to join. When the opening message is on screen
 * and names the parent, this draws nothing: one quote, not two.
 */

/**
 * The loaded message whose quote already names the parent: the chat's opening
 * message, when the parent's agent sent it and nothing older is still to
 * load. Null when there is none, which is when the link has to stand alone.
 *
 * The parent is the chat's parent now, not the sender of its first message.
 * The two start out the same and part when the chat is handed to another.
