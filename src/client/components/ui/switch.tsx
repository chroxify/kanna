          Pressing stretches the thumb toward the side it will travel to, as
          an iOS switch does: the press is answered on pointer-down, before
          the click commits. Width rather than scaleX, which would flatten
          the round ends; the thumb is 20px inside a fixed track, so nothing
          else reflows. Checked, it moves left by the stretch so its right
          edge stays put. Reduced motion drops the stretch and the slide;
          the track's colour still says which way it went. */}
