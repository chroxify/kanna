 * Within a section projects keep the order of the chats that put them there,
 * which below Relevant is newest first.
 *
 * Below Relevant there are two sections by age, not the Chats view's date
 * buckets. Those were cut for chats, which a section holds many of. There are
 * about a tenth as many projects, so three day sections and three more for
 * weeks left most headers over one or two rows, saying no more than the order
 * of the rows already does.
 *
 * Pinned holds the channels pinned in their own right (`pinnedAt`, kept by
 * the server with the project) and nothing else. A
 * pinned chat is not a pinned project: its pin is set aside here, and the chat
 * counts toward its project by status and age like any other.
 *
 * Projects with no chat in any section (none yet, or all archived) trail in a
 * section of their own, folded: a channel list has to keep them reachable,
 * which the Chats view has no need to.
