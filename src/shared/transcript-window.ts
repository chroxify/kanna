/**
 * How much of a transcript a client holds at once.
 *
 * Opening a long chat used to mount every row. The cost of that scales
 * with rows (layout, paint, DOM size, the teardown on leave), and an
 * 800-row chat took over a second on the main thread before it drew. So a
 * client now opens on a window counted in assistant messages, and loads
 * older windows on request.
 *
 * Counted in assistant messages rather than bytes or entries because rows
 * follow them: each assistant text is a row, and the tool calls between two
 * of them collapse into one group row. "50 assistant messages" is close to
 * the same number of rows every time; 100 KB was 20 rows of prose or 100
 * rows of tool headers. Cutting right before an assistant message also
 * never splits a tool group, since a group ends where the next assistant
 * text begins.
 *
 * Shared between server (which sizes the window it sends) and client (which
 * trims its own cached window to the same size before it paints).
