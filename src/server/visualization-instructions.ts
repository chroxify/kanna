 * 8,000 characters this one reached Claude as its first quarter, and an agent
 * that saw the mark went and read the rest out of Kanna's installed bundle.
 * So the description is short, opens with what decides the first lines of
 * markup, and names where the rest is: the session instructions, which every
 * harness gets whole (`harness-instructions.ts`). Every chat pays for those,
 * drawing or not, which is the price of a model never having to go and ask.

  "Options and settings go on their own row above the content, in the host's two styled controls, not an ad-hoc row of buttons or a native <select>. A few mutually exclusive options are a segmented control: <div class=\"kanna-segmented\" role=\"radiogroup\" aria-label=\"Range\"><button role=\"radio\" aria-checked=\"true\">7d</button><button role=\"radio\" aria-checked=\"false\">30d</button></div>. Switching whole views is tabs: class=\"kanna-tabs\" role=\"tablist\" with role=\"tab\" aria-selected buttons. Both are styled from the aria state, so set it on click; keep <select> for more than about six options.",
  "The host supplies typography and live light/dark colors. Body text is 16px and inherited: prose, labels and controls stay at that size or larger, and only secondary labels go smaller, never under 12px. Use var(--font-sans) and var(--font-mono) only when an explicit font is needed. Use CSS variables directly as colors: --foreground, --background, --muted-foreground, --border, --surface, and --viz-red, --viz-green, --viz-blue, --viz-yellow, --viz-orange, --viz-purple, --viz-pink, --viz-teal (also --chart-1 through --chart-8). Do not wrap these in hsl(). Avoid hardcoded light or dark backgrounds. For canvas, read colors and fonts from computed styles, wait for document.fonts.ready, and redraw on the kanna:themechange event.",
  `Make it feel like part of the reply: keep html, body and the outer wrapper transparent, with no outer card, border, shadow, page padding, or oversized headline. Use the available width, natural document height, and a layout that holds down to 320px; recompute on ResizeObserver, do not merely shrink an SVG full of text. Avoid 100vh and percentage page heights because the host sizes the frame to its contents. The frame fits the content up to ${VISUALIZATION_MAX_HEIGHT}px; anything taller scrolls inside the frame with no scrollbar showing, so split long content or put it behind tabs.`,
  "The page's height must never change after it first renders. No interaction may grow or shrink it: a tab, toggle, filter, opened row, added text, validation message or tooltip all have to fit in the height the page already has, because a frame that changes height moves the whole conversation under the reader. Size the page for its tallest state up front: give every area that swaps content one fixed height (the tallest view's), reserve the room for anything that appears later, lay tooltips and popovers over the content, and let a list that can grow scroll inside its own fixed-height box.",
  "Use touch-friendly controls, keyboard navigation, and reduced-motion support. On iOS the inline result is a live picture that opens full screen on a tap, so the first view must read before any interaction. A vertical drag scrolls the page unless the element under the finger sets touch-action: none; put that on the draggable element itself, never on the whole page.",

  "One chart per visualization, by default: one chart answers one question. Put more than one in a single visualization only when they share something separate ones cannot: one control or selection that drives all of them (a range or segment picker, a click in one chart that filters another), or small multiples of the same measure that are read by comparing them. A headline figure or two above a chart is part of that chart. Do not build a dashboard because the data allows one.",
  "Every chart shows the values of the data under the pointer or finger, always, not only when asked, and shows them at the data: highlight the mark itself (the others may dim) and anchor a popover beside it with the label and values. Never a readout in a fixed line of text or a panel elsewhere on the page that changes as the pointer moves. On a line or area chart the highlight is a marker on each series at the nearest x, with a vertical guide; on bars, the bar. It works by mouse hover, by touch (a tap, and a drag along the chart) and by keyboard focus on the marks. Use the host's popover: a <div class=\"kanna-tooltip\" hidden> inside a position:relative wrapper around the chart, shown by removing hidden and placed with left and top. It sits over the chart and ignores the pointer. The frame clips whatever leaves it, so flip or shift the popover to keep it inside the frame's edges and out of the top-right corner, and do not animate its movement. On iOS tooltips appear only full screen: label the most important values directly.",
  "Give a chart a fixed pixel height with fluid width. Axis ticks and legends may be smaller than body text. Include units and source or denominator caveats; neutral labels and colored marks. Separate panels with a shared time axis are often clearer than unrelated dual y-axes. For CSV export call window.kanna.download({filename: 'data.csv', content: csvText, mimeType: 'text/csv'}) in a click handler; it also takes text/plain and application/json, up to 2 MB, and opens the share sheet on iOS. Do not use blob download links.",

  "Keep it legible at 320px: flow top to bottom, or lay the nodes out from the container's width and restack them when it is narrow, and never shrink the text to fit; node labels stay at 13px or more. Every node is labelled, edges that carry meaning are labelled too, and directed ones have arrowheads. Strokes and text use --foreground, --muted-foreground and --border; fills are --surface or a --viz color mixed toward transparent. Color means something stated in a legend, or it is not used.",
  `A diagram too large for ${VISUALIZATION_MAX_HEIGHT}px is split by level, or stepped through with a kanna-segmented picker over one fixed-height stage.

Put directions that need realistic size (a screen, a flow, anything with its own interactions) behind a kanna-segmented picker on its own row at the top, short of the clear corner, one direction on the stage at a time, in realistic surrounding context, with instant swaps. Put small things that are judged by eye (buttons, cards, icons, color or type options) side by side instead, each under its name. Give the stage one fixed height, the tallest direction's. Support touch/click and number/arrow keys; ignore shortcuts while editing inputs or holding modifiers. Keep the selection in memory: there is no URL, history or localStorage in the sandbox.`,
  "Every direction needs working local interactions, realistic copy, and explicit simulated backend/AI behavior where appropriate; do not imply a demo sends messages, generates real images, or saves production data. Cards, dialogs, and other surfaces being prototyped are allowed inside the otherwise unframed result. Prefer sub-300ms transform/opacity motion, ease-out entrances, and a replay control when useful.",

After explicit selection, integrate only the winner and remove temporary prototype source files unless asked to keep them.",
