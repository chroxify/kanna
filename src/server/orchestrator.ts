/**
 * What an agent can do to chats, and the rules that keep that safe.
 *
 * Every write here is something the user can already do from the client, and
 * it runs the same function the WebSocket router runs for the user
 * (`chat-commands.ts`). What this file adds is the actor: each method takes
 * the id of the chat whose agent is asking, and checks the rules that apply
 * to an agent before the command runs.
 *
 * A sub-chat is a chat with a parent link, not a separate kind of object. The
 * link carries three behaviours: the sub-chat's result goes back to the parent
 * as a message, the parent is not finished while the sub-chat runs, and
 * stopping the parent stops the sub-chat.
 *
 * A chat the parent adopted (`send_message` with `adopt`) was not started by
 * it and may be one the user works in. It gets the first behaviour whole. It
 * holds the parent only while it owes a report, and stopping the parent
 * leaves it running. `ChatRecord.adopted` marks it.
